Here we are using Convolution Neural Nets on the classic MNIST dataset.

We get an accuracy of 99.8 % on the Training Set and 98.8 % on the Test Set which clearly signifies that the data is well trained.

Note: 5 epochs would have been enough... however u can try it using a bigger number like 25 (like i did).
